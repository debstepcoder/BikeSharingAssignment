## General Information
This project aims to build a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes. The dataset provided contains various independent variables such as weather conditions, season, and year, which will be used to predict the total number of bike rentals. The business problem addressed here is to assist a bike-sharing provider, BoomBikes, in understanding the factors influencing bike demand and in devising strategies to meet customer expectations efficiently. The dataset used for this project is the Bike Sharing dataset provided.

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1: The demand for shared bikes is influenced by various factors such as weather conditions, seasonality, and user type.
- Conclusion 2: Certain variables like 'season' and 'weathersit' need to be converted into categorical string values to prevent misinterpretation.
- Conclusion 3: The 'yr' column, indicating the year, should not be overlooked despite having only two values (0 and 1) as it contributes to understanding demand dynamics.
- Conclusion 4: The 'cnt' variable, representing the total number of bike rentals, is used as the target variable for model building.
