## General Information
This project aims to build a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes. The dataset provided contains various independent variables such as weather conditions, season, and year, which will be used to predict the total number of bike rentals. The business problem addressed here is to assist a bike-sharing provider, BoomBikes, in understanding the factors influencing bike demand and in devising strategies to meet customer expectations efficiently. The dataset used for this project is the Bike Sharing dataset provided.

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1: The demand for shared bikes is influenced by various factors such as weather conditions, seasonality, and user type.
- Conclusion 2: When temperature increases the demand increases, should keep track of the weather conditions.
- Conclusion 3: Light Snow & Rain will depreciate the demand, should monitor weather forcast.
- Conclusion 4: During Winter season the demand rises, hence it should be well prepared to meet the high demand.
